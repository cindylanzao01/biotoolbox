==OPTIONS==
The command line flags and descriptions:

__--in <**filename>

__
  Specify the input GFF3 file. The file should not be compressed with gzip.
__
  __
__--out <**filename>

__
  Specify the output filename. By default it uses input file base name  appened with '`_`refseq.txt'.

==DESCRIPTION==
This program will convert a GFF3 annotation file to a UCSC-style  gene table, similar to that obtained through the UCSC Table Browser.  Specifically, it matches the format of the refGene (!RefSeq** Genes) and  ensGene (Ensembl Genes) tables.

It will assemble the exon starts, stops, and frames from the defined  transcript features in the GFF3 file. This assumes the standard  parent->child relationship using the primary tags of  gene -> mRNA -> `[`CDS, five_prime_utr, three_prime_utr`]`.  Additional features (exon, start_codon, stop_codon, transcript)  will be safely ignored.

It will also process non-coding transcripts, including all non-coding  RNAs; all subfeatures of non-coding RNAs will be considered as exons.

The cdsStartStat and cdsEndStat fields are populated depending on  whether five- or three-prime UTRs exist; this may or may not reflect  the actual status according to UCSC.

The bin field is reserved for internal UCSC database use; it is  automatically filled with a generic 0 in the output file.
