==NAME==
get_feature_info.pl

A script to feature information from a Bioperl !SeqFeature**::Store db.

==SYNOPSIS==
get_feature_info.pl <**filename>

{{{
  --in <filename> 
  --db <name>
  --attrib <attribute1,attribute2,...>
  --out filename
  --(no)gz
  --version
  --help
}}}
Attributes include:    chromo    start    stop    midpoint    length    strand    phase    score    exon_count    transcript_length (sum of exon lengths)    parent (name)    <**tag>

{{{
}}}
==OPTIONS==
The command line flags and descriptions:

__--in <**filename>

__
  Specify the file name of a previously generated feature dataset. It should be in the tim data format that is generated by this program and others, although other tab-delimited text data formats may be usable. See the file description in `tim_db_helper.pm`.
__
  __
__--db <**name>

__
  Specify the name of the !BioPerl** gff database to use as source. This is required  for new feature data files. For pre-existing input data files, this argument  is optional, but if given it overrides the database listed in the file; this  is useful for collecting data from multiple databases.
__
  __
__--attrib <**attribute>

__
  Specify the attribute to collect for each feature. Standard GFF attributes  may be collected, as well as values from specific group tags. These tags  are found in the group (ninth) column of the source GFF file. Standard  attributes include the following
__
  __
{{{
   -chromo
   -start
   -stop
   -midpoint
   -length
   -strand
   -phase
   -score
   -exon_count (number of exons, or CDS, subfeatures)
   -transcript_length
   -parent (name)
}}}
  If attrib is not specified on the command line, then an interactive list  will be presented to the user for selection. Especially useful when you  can't remember the feature's tag keys in the database.
__
  __
__--out <**filename>

__
  Optionally specify an alternate output file name. The default is to  overwrite the input file.
__
  __
__--(no)gz

__
  Indicate whether the output file should (not) be compressed by gzip.  If compressed, the extension '.gz' is appended to the filename. If a compressed  file is opened, the compression status is preserved unless specified otherwise.
__
  __
__--version

__
  Print the version number.
__
  __
__--help

__
  Display this help.
__
  __
==DESCRIPTION==
This program will collect attributes for a list of features from the database.  The attributes may be general attributes, such as chromsome, start, stop,  strand, etc., or feature specific attributes stored in the original group  field of the original source GFF file.
