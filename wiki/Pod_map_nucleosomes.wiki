==OPTIONS==
The command line flags and descriptions:

__--db <**database_name>

__
  Specify the name of the !BioPerl** gff database to pull the source data.
__
  __
__--data, --sdata, --tdata <**dataset_name>

__
  Provide the name of the dataset(s) containing the nucleosome midpoint occupancy data from which to identify nucleosomal positions. Two  datasets are required, the scan dataset (--sdata) and the tag dataset  (--tdata). The same dataset could be used for both; in which case  set both to the same using the --data option. See the DESCRIPTION for  details regarding the datasets. If the datasets are not specified on  the commandline, then they may be interactively chosen from a list  from the database.
__
  __
__--thresh <**number>

__
  Provide the minimum score value required to call a nucleosome position.  This is only used when scanning the scan dataset.
__
  __
__--win <**integer>

__
  Provide the window size for which to scan the chromosome. Setting this   value too large and overlapping nucleosomes may result, while setting  this value too low may miss some nucleosomes. The default value is 150 bp.
__
  __
__--buf <**integer>

__
  Provide the buffer size in bp which will be added between the end of the  previous found nucleosome and the beginning of the window to scan for the  next nucleosome. Setting this value may limit the number of overlapping  nucleosomes. Default is 0 bp.
__
  __
__--bin

__
  Indicate whether the scan data should be binned in an attempt to find  and map a nucleosome midpoint peak. Binning only occurs when a single  position fails to pass the threshold value. Bins are generated from  three adjacent positions and their values summed. This may help   those genomic regions with very few nucleosome reads. The default is  to not bin the scan data.
__
  __
__--gff

__
  Indicate whether a GFF file should be written in addition to the standard  text data file. The GFF file version is 3. The default value is false.
__
  __
__--type <**gff_type>

__
  Provide the text to be used as the GFF type (or method) used in  writing the GFF file. The default value is the name of the scan  dataset appended with "`_`nucleosome".
__
  __
__--source <**gff_source>

__
  Provide the text to be used as the GFF source used in writing the  GFF file. The default value is the name of this program.
__
  __
__--out <**filename>

__
  Specify the output file name. The default is the name of the scan  dataset appended with "`_`nucleosome".
__
  __
__--version

__
  Print the version number.
__
  __
__--help

__
  Display the POD documentation of the script.

==DESCRIPTION==
This program will identify and map the positions of nucleosomes given a  dataset of nucleosome occupancy data. The dataset should ideally be  enumerated counts of sequenced nucleosomal fragment midpoints, although  very high resolution microarray data could also be used in principle.

Nucleosome calls are made by scanning the chromosomes in windows of  specified size (default 150 bp, set with --win option) looking for  the maximum peak that exceeds the minimum threshold value. The position  of the maximum peak is called as the new nucleosome midpoint. The  window is then advanced starting at the previous just-identified nucleosome  endpoint, or at the end of the previous window if no nucleosome was  identified. This position may be further advanced by setting the  buffer value, which inserts space between the previous nucleosome end and  the next window. By advancing the window relative to the previously identified  nucleosome, the program can adapt to variable nucleosome spacing.

Two datasets must be provided for the mapping, although the same could be   used for both functions. The datasets should represent sequenced nucleosome  fragment midpoints. For the most accurate mapping, the midpoints  should be mapped at 1 bp resolution, but lower resolutions (5 or 10 bp)  could work.

The scan dataset (--sdata) is used to scan for a potential nucleosome. The dataset may be a simple difference, normalized difference,  P-value, False Discovery Rate, or simply raw enumerated counts. Probability  scores should be converted using -10Log10(P) for proper interpretation.

The tag dataset (--tdata) is used for calculating nucleosome statistics,  including the precise nucleosome midpoint peak, occupancy, and fuzziness. The tag dataset must be enumerated counts of nucleosome midpoints and be whole integers, whether raw counts or a simple difference. Negative counts from a difference dataset are not counted.

For genomic regions with few nucleosome reads and no positions that pass the  threshold value, the window positions may optionally be binned together to  increase sensitivity (see the --bin option).

Two attributes of each identified nucleosome are calculated, Occupancy and  Fuzziness. Occupancy represents the sum of the tag counts that support the  nucleosome position; higher scores indicate a more highly occupied  nucleosome. Fuzziness indicates how well all of the scores are aligned in  register. The Fuzziness value is the standard deviation of the population  of scores from the peak; a high value indicates the nucleosome has a  fuzzy or variable position, whereas a low value indicates the nucleosome  is highly positioned. For both attributes, the scores are counted in a  window representing 1/2 of a nucleosome length (74 bp) centered on the  defined nucleosome midpoint. The size of this window is arbitrary but  reasonable.

The identified nucleosomes are set to 147 bp in length, centered at the  maximum peak. A second script, `get_actual_nuc_sizes.pl`, will determine  the actual nucleosome sizes based on paired-end reads in a BAM file.
