==NAME==
locate_SNPs.pl

==SYNOPSIS==
{{{
 locate_SNPs.pl --db <database> <snp_file1> ...
  }}}
{{{
  Options:
  --in <snp_file>
  --db <database>
  --features type1,type2,...
  --help
}}}
==OPTIONS==
The command line flags and descriptions:

__--in <**snp_file>

__
  Specify the name(s) of the input SNP file. Multiple files may be  specified using multiple --in arguments, with a single --in argument and a  comma delimited list, or as a list at the end of all options. The files may  kept gzipped; they will automatically be uncompressed.
__
  __
__--db

__
  Specify the name of a Bio::DB::!SeqFeature**::Store database that contains the  genome annotation and sequence. Alternatively, a single GFF3 genome  annotation file may be provided, in which case it is loaded in memory. This is required.
__
  __
__--features type1,type2,...

__
  Provide a comma-delimited list (no spaces) of the GFF feature types of the  genes to intersect with the SNPs. Complex gene structures (gene->mRNA->CDS)  should be able to be parsed to look for amino-acid changes. If a list is  not provided, the default list will then include gene, ncRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, and tRNA.
__
  __
__--help

__
  This help text.
__
  __
==DESCRIPTION==
This program will locate SNPs and other sequence variants and identify  which gene the variant is located in, the type of polymorphism (insertion,  deletion, substitution), and, if the variant is located within a CDS, whether  a codon change is generated.

The input files should be files generated using the varFilter function of the samtools.pl script, included with the !SamTools** distribution <[http://samtools.sourceforge.net]>. That script will generate a list of the sequence variations that differ from the reference genome. No verification of the source file format is performed. The files may be gzipped.
