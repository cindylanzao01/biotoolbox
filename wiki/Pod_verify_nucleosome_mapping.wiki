==DESCRIPTION==
This program will verify the mapping of nucleosomes. It expects as input  the output data file from 'map_nucleosomes.pl'. Nucleosomes are verified  by comparing the peak of nucleosome reads collected from the original  dataset with the recorded midpoint of the mapped nucleosome. If the peak  is <= 10 bp from the recorded midpoint, then the nucleosome is considered  centered on the peak and it is properly mapped. If the peak is > 10 bp  from the recorded midpoint, then it is considered offset, or improperly  mapped. This is most often due to nucleosomes being called prematurely  when the dataset is being scanned in windows from left to right.  Adjusting the parameters for window and buffer in map_nucleosomes.pl can  limit the number of overlapping nucleosomes.

The same data file is re-written with three additional columns appended,  overlap_length, center_peak_mapping, and center_peak_offset.

Overlap_length records the amount of overlap between mapped nucleosomes.  Ideally this should be 0 as nucleosomes should not overlap; overlapping  nucleosomes indicate an error in mapping or multiple phasing of nucleosomes.

Center_peak_mapping records whether the nucleosome was properly mapped or  not; one of two values is recorded: centered or offset.

Center_peak_offset records the distance in bp between the nucleosome peak  and the recorded midpoint.
