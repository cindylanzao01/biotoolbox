==DESCRIPTION==
This program will merge two or more tab-delimited data files into one file.  Datasets (columns) from each file are interactively chosen and then merged  into an output file. Datasets from the third and subsequent files are  added to the end (rightmost column) of the first two merged files.

The program blindly assumes that rows (features) are equivalent in all of the  datasets if there are an equal number of data rows. However, if there are an  unequal number of data rows, or the user forces by using the --lookup option,  then dataset values are looked up first using specified lookup values before  merging (compare with Excel VLOOKUP function). In this case, the dataset  lookup indices from each file are requested, followed by the order of datasets  to merge. The first index in the order determines which file is dominant,  meaning that all rows from that file are included, and only the rows that  match by lookup value are included from the second file. Null values are  recorded when no match is found in the second file.

After merging, an opportunity for renaming the dataset names is  presented.
