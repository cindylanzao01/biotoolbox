## NAME ##
change\_cluster\_order.pl

A script to change the order of gene cluster groups in a file.

## SYNOPSIS ##
change\_cluster\_order.pl `[`--options...`]` <filename>

```
  Options:
  --in <filename>
  --out <basename>
  --order <numbers,range>
  --keep
  --version
  --help
```
## OPTIONS ##
The command line flags and descriptions:

--in <filename>


> Specify either the input CDT or KGG file. The program assumes both  files exist with the same basename and either a .kgg or .cdt file  extension.

> 
--out <basename>


> Specify the output filename. By default it uses the base name of the  input file. An appropriate .kgg and .cdt extension will be added.

> 
---order <numbers,range>


> Optionally provide the new order of gene cluster groups. A comma  delimited list and/or range may be provided, without spaces. For  example, 1-3,0,4,5.

> 
--keep


> Optionally keep the same cluster group numbers in the KGG file as  the original, just in the new order. The default is to renumber  the group numbers.

> 
--version


> Print the version number.

> 
--help


> Display this POD documentation.

## DESCRIPTION ##
This program will change the order of gene cluster groups in KGG and CDT files.  These files are generated by the Cluster algorithm and represent k-means  clusters of genes based on collected experimental data. The cluster groups  are defined in the KGG file, which is a simple text format with two columns,  the gene ID and the GROUP number. Sometimes, when comparing data between two   or more separate cluster analyses, it is useful to re-order the clusters such  that similar clusters are ranked in a similar order. This script will  accomplish that goal.

A KGG or CDT file is provided (both are required, but only one needs to be  provided as a command line argument). The current order of the clusters is  presented, and a new order is then requested. The new groups are re-labeled  with new identifiers, or the old group numbers may be retained if requested.

CDT files may be visualized using the Java Treeview program, found at  <http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net>.
