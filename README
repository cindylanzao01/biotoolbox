Bio::ToolBox - Tools for querying and analysis of genomic data

DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of libraries and high-quality end-user 
scripts for bioinformatic analysis, particularly of genomic data 
obtained from microarray and next-generation sequencing.

The original project was focused primarily on the generation of 
functional end-user scripts for bioinformatic data conversion, 
processing, collection, and analysis. The libraries were initially 
simply shared code for these scripts. However, they are fully 
documented, and may be used as the basis for writing additional 
analysis scripts.

In many cases, the Bio::ToolBox scripts provide an abstraction 
layer over a variety of different specialized BioPerl-style 
modules. For example, there is a special emphasis on the collection 
data values for defined genomic coordinate regions, regardless of 
whether the values come from a GFF database, Bam file, BigWig file, 
etc. 

There is also an emphasis on using industry-standard file formats, 
such as BED and GFF3, as well as simple tab-delimited text files 
that may be imported or exported from a variety of other applications. 
Retention of metadata is accomplished by simply prefixing comment 
lines at the beginning of the file.

Currently the libraries are implemented as simple subroutines that 
must be imported into a script's namespace. They are not implemented 
as object-oriented modules, although that may be partially rectified 
in the future.

The included scripts are production-quality programs for processing, 
converting, analyzing, and manipulating genomic data and/or features. 
These programs include the following capabilities
	
	* Tools for converting data formats between popular formats, including
	  GFF3, wig, bed, BAM, bigWig, bigBed, and others
	* Collecting data relative to any annotated genomic feature
	* Manipulation and analysis of collected data
	* Generating simple graphs of collected data
	* Processing raw microarray files
	* Simple processing of Next Generation Sequencing alignment files
	* Precise mapping of nucleosomes from paired-end sequencing



REQUIREMENTS

The programs have been developed and used on Mac OS X versions 10.5 through
10.8. The programs should work on any sane unix-like environment, including
Linux; Microsoft Windows compatability is not tested nor guaranteed.

A working Perl environment is, of course, also required, and usually
present in virtually every unix-like operating system distribution. Perl
versions 5.10 and 5.12 have been tested. 64-bit executable is desireable, but 
not required, if only because some of the data files can get particularly
large, leading to out-of-memory errors with 32-bit Perl.

Several different Perl modules are required for specific programs to work, 
most notably BioPerl, among a few others. Most of these dependencies can 
be taken care of by the Installer.

A C compiler such as gcc is preferred and required for many of the Perl 
modules. Limited functions may be available without it. On Linux, these 
tools may be readily installed through your distribution package manager. 
On Mac OS X, you will need to install the XCode application (available 
from the Mac App Store) and specifically install the Command Line Tools 
through its Preferences (optional documentation is not needed).

INSTALLATION

Installation is simple with the standard Perl incantation.
    perl ./Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build install

USAGE OF PROVIDED SCRIPTS

*Configuration 
There is a configuration file that may be customized for your particular
installation. The default file is written to ~/.biotoolbox.cfg. It is a simple
INI-style file that is used to set up database connection profiles, feature
aliases, helper application locations, etc. The file is intended to be
edited by users. More documentation can be found in the 
Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::config documentation. This file is automatically 
written as needed; it is not installed by the Installer.

*Execution 
All biotoolbox scripts are designed to be run from the command line or
executed from another script. Some programs, for example
manipulate_datasets.pl, also provide an interactive interface to allow for
spontaneous work or when the exact index number or name of the dataset in
the file or database is not immediately known.

*Help 
All scripts require command line options for execution. Executing the
program without any options will present a synopsis of the options that are
available. Most programs also have a --help option, which will display
detailed information about the program and execution (usually by displaying
the internal POD). The options are given in the long format (--help, for
example), but may be shortened to single letters if the first letter is
unique (-h, for example).

*File Formats 
Many of the programs are designed to input and output a file format
referred to in colloquial tems as a 'tim data format'. This is merely a
tabbed-delimited text format (unix line endings), where the rows represent
genomic features, bins, etc. and the columns represent descriptive
information and data. The first line in the table are the column headings.

At the beginning of the file are metadata lines, prefixed by a #, which
describe the content in each column using a simple key=value system. This
metadata is useful to describe how and where the data was obtained, and
what format it is in, for example log2. This frees up having to cram all
the metadata into the filename. The metadata lines are dispensible in most
cases, and can be safely deleted before importing the file into another
program, such as Excel. More detailed information can be found in the POD
documentation of tim_file_helper.pm or online.




UPDATES AND FIXES

The biotoolbox scripts are under continual development by the author. The 
latest distribution may be downloaded from the project website at 
http://code.google.com/p/biotoolbox/. 

The latest bugfixes and updates may also be obtained through SVN.

Please contact the author for bugs. Feature requests are also accepted, 
within time constraints. Contact information is at the project website.
