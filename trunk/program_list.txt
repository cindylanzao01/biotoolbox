PROGRAM LIST

This is an alphabetical list of the scripts available in the biotoolbox scripts directory.

average_gene.pl
	Generate class average summaries for a list of genes or features. Each gene is divided into a set number of bins and data is summarized in each bin. Use graph_profile.pl to plot the summary.
	
bam2gff.pl
	Generate features in GFF file format for each aligned read in a BAM file. It accepts both single-end and paired-end alignments. Alignments may be filtered by various criteria.

bar2wig.pl
	Convert binary bar data files from David Nix's USeq or T2 package to a more universal text wiggle (.wig) format. Alternatively, binary bigwig files (.bw) may be generated.
	
bed2gff.pl
	Convert a BED file to a GFF file.
	
bin_genomic_data.pl
	Collect genomic data from various sources into bins across the genome. Data may come from a .gff, .sgr, or .bam alignment file. The data values may be combined into one value for the bin, or features within the bin may be enumerated.
	
bw2gff3.pl
	Given a binary bigwig file, a GFF file is generated suitable for loading into a Bio::DB database. Each chromosome has one feature spanning its length, and the feature records the location of the bigwig file in the host's file system. This allows data to be collected from the Bio::DB database without having to specify multiple databases. Compare with the wiggle2gff3.pl program distributed with GBrowse.
	
convert_yeast_genome_version.pl
	Convert the genomic coordinates of a data file between different SGD genome versions.
	
data2frequency.pl
	Convert data into a frequency distribution, useful for graphing a histogram plot using a program such as graph_histogram.pl.
	
data2gff.pl
	Convert any data text file into a GFF file, so long as there are genomic coordinates within the file.
	
data2wig.pl
	Convert any data text file into into a text wiggle file, so long as it has genomic coordinates. Both fixed and variable step files may be generated depending on the source file coordinates. Alternatively, binary bigwig files may be generated.
	
find_enriched_regions.pl
	Scan across the genome with a sliding window and identify regions of enrichment (or depletion). Regions are identified when the window value exceeds a simple threshold. Overlapping or adjacent windows are merged. 
	
find_nucleosome_movement.pl
	Given a dataset of ratios between two nucleosome occupancies, nucleosome movements are identified by adjoining loss/gain events.
	
get_actual_nuc_sizes.pl
	Given mapped nucleosomes from the map_nucleosomes.pl program and a BAM file representing paired-end sequencing alignments of genomic nucleosomes, the actual sizes from the nucleosome sequencing are collected for each mapped nucleosome.
	
get_datasets.pl
	The workhorse program for collecting data stored in a Bio::DB database relative to any feature described in the database: genes, promoters, genomic bins, etc. The data is combined in one of a variety of statistical methods.
	
get_feature_info.pl
	Given a table of database features, additional information may be collected from the database for each feature. Infomation may include basic attributes such as chromosome, start, stop, strand, etc. Feature specific attributes (stored in the 9th column of the source GFF) may also be collected.

get_intersecting_features.pl
	Given a table of database features, intersecting features of the specified type may be collected. The region corresponding to the first list of features may be limited or expanded as desired. Useful in identifying, for example, genes which overlap enriched regions.

gff2sgr.pl
	Convert a GFF file into a simple SGR file (chromosome, position, value).
	
graph_data.pl
	Generate a XY line or scatter plot between two datasets. For scatter plots, a linear regression line is also plotted. Statistics on the correlation between the two datasets are also reported.
	
graph_histogram.pl
	Generate a histogram plot for one or two datasets. The data is binned into the designated number of bins and the graph plotted. The graph may be a line or bar plot.
	
graph_profile.pl
	Generate a graph of data plotted against a specific X-axis, such as genomic coordinates. Useful for plotting data that was collected relative to a specific position, such as a transcription start site. The data is plotted as a smoothed line.
	
intersect_nucs.pl
	A program to intersect two lists of called, identified nucleosomes. Overlapping nucleosomes are identified, and the distance of midpoint movement reported. 
	
join_data_file.pl
	Join two or more data files that were split using the split_data_file.pl program. The data files must have equal number of datasets (columns) and identical metadata.
	
just_blast_oligos.pl
	A program to identify the genomic positions of microarray oligo probes by aligning them to the genome using a local copy of NCBI BLAST. Partial hits may be included.
	
locate_SNPs.pl
	Identifies the overlapping gene and potential codon change associated with sequence variations. Uses the list of sequence variants generated by the SamTools' samtools.pl varFilter function.

manipulate_datasets.pl
	A program to manipulate datasets (columns) in a data file. A wide variety of manipulations may be performed, from re-ordering the columns to mathematically converting the data values to generating ratios between datasets. Multiple functions may be performed interactively or single functions performed automatically by command line options, allowing for easy scripting of manipulations.
	
map_data.pl
	Similar to get_datasets.pl, data stored in a database may be collected in bins flanking a specific landmark or coordinate of genomic features. For example, mapping histone modification data surrounding all transcription start sites in the genome.
	
map_nucleosomes.pl
	Similar to find_enriched_regions.pl, but specific for nucleosomes. Given a dataset of nucleosome occupancies, peaks of occupancy data are mapped and assigned to a nucleosome of standard 147 bp size. The next nucleosome occupancy peak is identified relative to the position of the prior identified nucleosome, assuming that nucleosomes are relatively regularly spaced.
	
map_oligo_data2gff.pl
	Map the processed microarray oligo data value (for example, from process_agilent.pl) to a genomic coordinate represented by the oligo probe. Probe positions may be mapped using just_blast_oligos.pl or any other alignment program. A GFF file is generated. 
	
map_transcripts.pl
	Given a dataset of transcriptome data (either RNA-hybridized tiling microarray or RNA-Sequencing), regions of enrichment (transcribed) are associated with annotated ORFs to identify transcription start and stop sites. Introns, alternative splicing, and intron-embedded unique genes are not identified.
	
merge_datasets.pl
	Merge the datasets (columns) of two or more data files into one file. The datasets may be interactively chosen. Each file must have the same number of features (rows).
	
merge_SNPs.pl
	Takes a two or more lists of sequence variants (as called by SamTools' samtools.pl varFilter function) and identify unique and common variants. Useful for separating strain-specific mutations from background polymorphisms.

my_gff2gff3.pl
	Convert GFF version 2 files to GFF version 3 files. Useful when transitioning from Bio::DB::GFF to Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store databases. Fairly specific to my situation.
	
novo_wrapper.pl
	A wrapper program for aligning one or more Illumina or other raw sequencing data using Novocraft's novoalign program. After aligning, it will convert the alignment file to an indexed binary BAM file.

print_feature_types.pl
	Quickly queries a given Bio::DB database and prints out the feature types present in the database. When datasets are stored in the database using unique feature types (breaking GFF3 conventions), this program provides a quick check of what datasets are currently stored and available.
	
process_agilent.pl
	Process the raw Agilent data text files from one or two-color microarray hybridizations. Multiple data experiments (biological or technical replicates) may be combined and quantile normalized together.
	
pull_features.pl
	Given a list of feature names, those features may be pulled from a large data file and re-written as a separate new file. Compare with Microsoft's Excel VLOOKUP function.
	
shift_coordinates.pl
	A program for shifting coordinates, for example from interbase (0-base) to 1-base.

split_bam_by_isize.pl
	Split a paired-end sequencing BAM alignment file into one or more separate files based on the predicted size of the insert. Useful for sorting paired-end sequencing of genomic nucleosomes by size.
	
split_bam_by_strand.pl
	Split a BAM alignment file into two BAM files based on the strand to which the sequence tag aligns. Useful for RNA-Seq experiments.
	
split_data_file.pl
	Split a text data file into two or more files based on specific values in one of the datasets (columns). For example, splitting a data file of genomic binned data by chromosome. Metadata is preserved in each split file. Useful for breaking extremely large data files into smaller, more easily managed files.
	
ucsc_chrom2gff3.pl
	Convert the UCSC chromosome information (chomInfo) file into a GFF3 file. This file is necessary for loading into a Bio::SeqFeature::Store database. 

ucsc_cytoband2gff3.pl
	A simple script to conver the UCSC cytobands file into a GFF3 file that can be used by the ideogram glyph of GBrowse. Useful with human genome databases where cytobands are annotated.
	
ucsc_table2gff3.pl
	A program to convert a gene table from UCSC into a GFF3 file suitable for loading into a Bio::SeqFeature::Store database. Any gene table should work, but refSeq and ensGene gene tables have been tested. Additional refSeq data may also be included (summary note, status, etc). Complete gene feature objects are generated (gene -> mRNA -> exon). Some identification of non-coding transcript types is done by inference from the gene name.

wig2data.pl
	Convert a text wiggle file into a tab-delimited tim data format text file. Fixed, variable, and BED style wig files are allowed.
