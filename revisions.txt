######## biotoolbox revision history #############

v.1.7.0 (svn r340)
	- Added new program get_gene_regions.pl which helps in retrieving regions not explicitly annotated in a database, including start and stop sites of transcription and introns.
	- Added new program data2fasta.pl which generates a multi-Fasta file from a tab-delimited text file of coordinates or a list of sequences, such as microarray probes.
	- Added new program compare_subfeature_scores.pl which compares a list of feature and subfeatures and find the subfeature with the minimum and maximum score.
	- Major update to the data collection scripts to improve memory consumption and efficiency, and a significant boost in speed when working with BigWig data sources (I have seen up to 10 fold increase, depending on collection methods).
	- Improvements when working with BigWigSet directories, including working with impromptu directories of BigWig files that do not have a defined metadata file.
	- Added the option of using separate annotation and data databases when using the data collection scripts. This greatly simplifies things when you have, for example, an annotation SeqFeature::Store database and a BigWigSet database of data.
	- Added the rpkm method to work with any segment, not just genes with exons, in data collection scripts get_datasets.pl and average_gene.pl
	- Fixed bugs in script ucsc_table2gff3.pl, data2wig.pl, and bar2wig.pl

v.1.6.4 (svn r314)
	- Major update to script bam2wig.pl to reduce memory consumption by writing incremental portions. The strand option is now a boolean option, and when enabled, automatically writes both strands simultaneously. The binning of read counts into windows of user-selected size is now possible. The optimal shift value for ChIP-Seq data can now be empically determined from the reads using a statistical method.
	- Added additional support for UCSC ensGene tables by including ensemblToGeneName and ensemblSource supplemental tables in script ucsc_table2gff2.pl. The common gene name is now included in the output GFF3 file.
	- Added rna_count function to script get_feature_info.pl
	- Added minimum and maximum value functions to script manipulate_datasets.pl
	- Included a range option when generating a summary file in script manipulate_datasets.pl
	- Improved the regular expression matching of the chromosome name when sorting by genomic coordinates in the script manipulate_datasets.pl
	- Increased the number of available letters when requesting indices from the second file in script merge_datasets.pl
	- Updated script check_dependencies.pl to handle missing dependencies more gracefully
	- Updated error handling of missing Perl module dependencies, including IO::Zlib
	- Fixed bug where the default chromosome exclusion list in biotoolbox.cfg wasn't being used when generating a new genome interval list
	- Fixed bug where where a script might ignore the --nogz option when the original file was gzipped
	- Fixed bug in script split_data_file.pl where a filename may get out of sync with what was requested and what is written

v.1.6.3 (svn r293)
	- Added knownGene as a source in script ucsc_table2gff3.pl
	- Improved handling of the chromosome exclusion list in library tim_db_helper

	- Fixed bug where an exception and crash could occur if the query chromosome is not present in a bigWig, bigBed, or Bam file when collecting data. Chromosome names are now checked prior to query.
	- Fixed bug in script get_datasets.pl where a null value is returned instead of 0 when using the method of sum.
	- Removed several minor bugs that could generate non-fatal Perl warnings

v.1.6.2 (svn r282)
	- Fixed bugs in script data2bed.pl that prevented a bigBed file from being generated. Also improved autodetection of data columns and allowed for dummy data to be inserted in lower column data when writing higher column data. Also added ability to use either the GFF Name or ID attribute as the Bed feature name.
	- Added span option to script data2wig.pl when making wig files.
	- Renamed script process_agilent.pl to process_microarray.pl. Completely restructured internal data to accomodate multi-slide arrays and other file formats, including NimbleGen and GenePix.
	- Removed annoying verbose output from script split_data_file.pl and improved efficiency.
	- Stopped writing index keys in the metadata of tim data file formats. Index is now automatically calculated and retained internally. Also avoids writing metadata automatically if it wasn't present in the first place.
	- Added summary export function to script manipulate_datasets.pl. This replicates the summary option from script get_relative_data.pl.
	- Added multi-column support to the subtract and division functions in script manipulate_datasets.pl.
	- Minor bug fixes and improvements to script map_oligo_data2gff.pl.
	- Improved script gff3_to_ucsc_table.pl to handle gzip files and make the UCSC bin column optional.
	- Added character escaping when generating GFF3 files.
	- Improved handling of BigWigSet directories in script big_file2gff3.pl where the set name is used as the final subdirectory in the target path. Also improved name handling.
	- Fixed bug in writing Sam files in script change_chr_prefix.pl. Also added increased support for pragmas and fasta sequences in GFF3 files, and support for non-standard text files.
	- Changed the score column name to the more meaningful outfile basename when writing summary files.
	- Fixed data collection from Bed files in script bin_genomic_data.pl.
